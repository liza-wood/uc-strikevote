# UC Strike Action: Digging into the data  

A repository for probing questions around graduate student pay in and beyond the University of California.  

Read a summary of the findings here:  
* [Comparison of grad student pay across the country](https://bit.ly/3TEZ2Jd)  
* [An analysis of grad student pay relative to UC faculty](http://bit.ly/3Gn7A3u)

A note to readers: These blog posts are put together through personal 'data blitz' efforts. I try to be thorough and transparent about my assumptions and interpretations of the data, but I certainly make mistakes and am not an expert across all of these areas.
